# Oxford-Class
Material for the class "Implementing a Visual STM" at the University of Oxford (June 2023)

## Brief description
In this class/workshop we will go over the foundations and implementation of a Visual Structural Topic Model for the detection of topics/themes in images. We will cover some "image basics", detail the steps necessary to create a Document-Feature matrix for images (รก la DTM, for texts), and get to see those steps in action using images from the Black Lives Matter 2014 protests published by prominent outlets in their Twitter feeds.

## A to-do list before the class
We will use the a Google Colab machine that has some code and material pre-loaded. The link for it is: .
Please follow these steps BEFORE you come to class:

1. Create a Google Drive account
2. Create a Google Colab account with the same e-mail as your Google Drive
3. Copy to your drive the folder "blm_images" from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VxxBq5IBbBfVHIouEdwrRfOHnKs3aVet?usp=share_link). Make sure the folder is still called that way.
4. Copy to your drive the folder "CVClass" from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ss271e6xX4DqZOpLk5zrgE_yg0Fn7vvn?usp=sharing).
5. Make sure you have R installed
6. Please install the stm packages in R.
7. Install the rhdf5 package in R. It has to be through Bioconductor and it takes some time, so plan accordingly. Check this [link](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/rhdf5.html) for more information.
8. Download the Functions2ProcessIVW.R file to your computer and remember its location. You can find in this GitHub site.
